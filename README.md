## Awesome Name [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

### Why

1. How to name the variable is a headache thing, not only the semantic and simple, but also
universal. After all, just for the maintainability. So I want to record the name frequently used.

2. More for the easily name and code efficiently. Little by little we can enjoy our code, because your 
code can make another sense to others, afford for thought. Such as:
	
	* __Promise__: I didn't know Why the JavaScript's Asynchronous Programming Standard was called
	__Promise__. But when i thought it in deepth, i got it. When we fetch some data from the server,
	we didn't kown whether the response or not. What the Promise meaning is you have my word, i will
	promise to give your response, whether success or failure.

	* __on__ and __off__ in __JQuery__: simple, easy and visual.
	* __fork__: you can use fork to select what your favorite food and eat at your disposal


### Abbreviation

#### How

1. Grab some letters in front of the words: __min__ __sec__ __tel__
2. Remove the vowel and keep the consonant: __msg__ __src__ __mgr__
3. Use the homophonic letter to replace: __4__ __2__ __r__
4. Reference to __HTML tag__、__zepto__ __jquery__ and other library、__linux command__
5. __Other__: [tj countries](https://github.com/component/countries) many countries
